2. Input parameters are defined, including the lot size, stop loss, take profit, and RSI period.
3. The OnTick function is called on each tick of the market.
4. The RSI value is calculated using the iRSI function.
5. If the RSI value is above 70, indicating an overbought market:
   - If there is an open buy position, it is closed.
   - If there is no open sell position, a sell position is opened with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit.
6. If the RSI value is below 30, indicating an oversold market:
   - If there is an open sell position, it is closed.
   - If there is no open buy position, a buy position is opened with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit.
7. If there is an open position:
   - The moving average value is calculated using the iMA function.
   - If the current price is above the moving average and the open position is a sell position, it is closed.
   - If the current price is below the moving average and the open position is a buy position, it is closed.
8. The OnInit function is called during EA initialization to set up the trade and moving averages objects.
9. The OnDeinit function is called when the EA is stopped to clean up the trade object.
